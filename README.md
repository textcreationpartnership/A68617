    _ CHAP. XVII. A Discourse of Trade from England vnto the East Indies: Answering to diuers Obiections which are vsually made against the same.

It were a happie thing for Christendome (say many men) that the Nauigation to the East Indies, by way of the Cape of Good Hope, had neuer been found out; For in the fleets of  shippes, which are sent thither yeerely out of England, Portugall, and the Low-countreyes; The Gold, Siluer, and Coyne of Christendome, and particularly of this Kingdome, is exhausted, to buy vnnecessary wares.

The Answere.

      * The second Obiection.  The Timber, Planke, and other materials, for making of shipping, is exceedingly wasted, and made dearer,, by the building of so many great Ships, as are yeerely sent to Trade in the East Indies; and yet the State hath no vse of any of them vpon occasion. For either they are not here; or else they come home very weake and vnseruiceable.

The Answere.

      * The third Obiection. The Voyages to the East Indies doe greatly consume our victuals, and our Mariners: leauing many poore Widdowes and Children vnrelieued; Besides, that many Shippes are yeerely sent forth to the East Indies, and few we see as yet returned; Also, this Trade hath greatly decayed the Traffique and shipping, which were woont to be imployed into the Streights: And yet the said Trade to the East Indies, is found very vnprofitable to the Aduenturers: Neither doth the Common-wealth find any benefit by the cheapenesse of Spice and Indico, more then in times past.

The Answere.

      * The fourth Obiection. It is generally obserued, that his Maiesties Mint hath had but little imployment euer since the East India Trade began; wherefore it is manifest, that the onely remedy for this, and so many euils besides, is to put downe this Trade: For what other remedie can there be for the good of the Common-wealth?

The Answere.
